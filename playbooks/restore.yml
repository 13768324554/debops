# Use this playbook to restore data backed up by 'backup.sh'. The best moment to
# restore the data on the remote host is just after installation and
# configuration of sudo access (either after running 'newhost.sh' script, or
# after host reboot when using automatic Debian preseeding (see 'apt' role),
# before the launch of main 'site.sh' script.

# After restoring the data you might need to remove old host fingerprint from
# ~/.ssh/known_hosts, if IP address of the remote host has been changed.
