# role: safekeep (centralized rdiff-backup script)
# SafeKeep website: http://safekeep.sourceforge.net/


# Currently safekeep role does not support all SafeKeep features and is geared
# toward backing up virtual machines (no LVM support, no bandwidth throttling)

# Role expects SafeKeep packages (safekeep-*) to be available via apt-get (in
# other words, accessible via apt repository), which isn't true for at least
# Debian Wheezy. You can configure your own apt repository using 'reprepro' role
# via 'apt' role and put downloaded SafeKeep .deb packages there. You can
# download SafeKeep here: http://safekeep.sourceforge.net/download.shtml


# FQDN hostname of SafeKeep server to which other clients will be backed up
safekeep: ""

# Should SafeKeep be enabled for current (client) host?

# Retention time for incremental backup

# You should configure here hosts that are outside of Ansible cluster (not
# controlled by a playbook) that you want to backup using SafeKeep manually
