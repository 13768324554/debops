# role: postfix (High-performance mail transport agent)


# List of postfix capabilities - what postfix can and should do on a host. Set
# this to False and disable postfix support, set it to [] and have Ansible not
# do anything with postfix (unsupported). Not all combinations of these
# capabilities will work correctly (role is still in alpha stage).
#
# - null: postfix has no local delivery, all mail is sent to a MX for current
#   domain. Configuration similar to that presented here:
#   http://www.postfix.org/STANDARD_CONFIGURATION_README.html#null_client
#   Default. You should remove this capability and replace it with others
#   presented below.
#
# - local: local delivery is enabled on current host.
#
# - network: enables access to postfix-related ports (25, 587, 465) in
#   firewall, required for incoming mail to be acceped by postfix.
#
# - mx: enables support for incoming mail on port 25, designed for hosts set up
#   as MX. Automatically enables postscreen (without dnsbl/dnswl support),
#   anti-spam restrictions.
#
# - submission: enables authorized mail submission on ports 25 and 587 (user
#   authentication is currently not supported and needs to be configured
#   separately).
#
# - deprecated: designed to enable obsolete functions of mail system, currently
#   enables authorized mail submission on port 465 (when submission also present
#   in the list of capabilities).
#
# - postscreen: allows to enable postscreen support on port 25 independently of
#   mx support.
#
# - dnsbl: enables support for DNS blacklists in postscreen, automatically
#   enables whitelists.
#
# - dnswl: enables support for DNS whitelists in postscreen, without blacklists.
#
# - test: enables "soft_bounce" option and XCLIENT protocol extension for
#   localhost (useful in mail system testing).
#
# - defer: planned feature to defer mail delivery.
#
# - auth: planned feature to enable user authentication.
