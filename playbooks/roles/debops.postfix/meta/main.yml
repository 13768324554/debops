  synopsis: |
    This role installs and manages [Postfix](http://postfix.org/), an SMTP
    server.
    
    `debops.postfix` role is designed to manage Postfix on different hosts in
    a cluster, with different "capabilities". At the moment role can configure
    Postfix to act as:
    
    * a null client: Postfix sends all mail to another system specified
      either via DNS MX records or an Ansible variable, no local mail is enabled
      (this is the default configuration);
    * a local SMTP server: local mail is delivered to local user accounts;
    * a network SMTP server: network access is enabled separately from other
      capabilities, to avoid exposing misconfigured SMTP server by mistake and
      becoming an open relay;
    * an incoming MX gateway: Postfix will listen on the port 25 (default SMTP
      port) and process connections using `postscreen` daemon with automatic
      greylisting and optional RBL checking;
    
    More "capabilities" like user authentication, support for virtual mail,
    spam/virus filtering and others will be implemented in the future.
    
    This role can also be used as a dependency of other roles which then can
    enable more features of the Postfix SMTP server for their own use. For
    example, `debops.mailman` role enables mail forwarding to the configured
    mailing lists, and `debops.smstools` role uses Postfix as mail-SMS gateway.

  usage: |
    List of Postfix capabilities in `postfix` variable - what Postfix can and
    should do on a host. Set this to `False` and disable Postfix support, set it
    to `[]` and have Ansible not do anything with Postfix (unsupported). Not all
    combinations of these capabilities will work correctly (role is still in
    beta stage).
    
    - `null`: Postfix has no local delivery, all mail is sent to a MX for current
      domain. Configuration similar to that presented here:
      http://www.postfix.org/STANDARD_CONFIGURATION_README.html#null_client
      Default. You should remove this capability and replace it with others
      presented below.
    
    - `local`: local delivery is enabled on current host.
    
    - `network`: enables access to Postfix-related ports (`25`, `587`, `465`) in
      firewall, required for incoming mail to be acceped by Postfix.
    
    - `mx`: enables support for incoming mail on port `25`, designed for hosts set up
      as MX. Automatically enables `postscreen` (without `dnsbl`/`dnswl` support),
      anti-spam restrictions.
    
    - `submission`: enables authorized mail submission on ports `25` and `587` (user
      authentication is currently not supported and needs to be configured
      separately).
    
    - `deprecated`: designed to enable obsolete functions of mail system,
      currently enables authorized mail submission on port `465` (when
      `submission` is also present in the list of capabilities).
    
    - `postscreen`: allows to enable postscreen support on port `25` independently of
      `mx` capability.
    
    - `dnsbl`: enables support for DNS blacklists in postscreen, automatically
      enables whitelists.
    
    - `dnswl`: enables support for DNS whitelists in postscreen, without blacklists.
    
    - `test`: enables "soft_bounce" option and XCLIENT protocol extension for
      localhost (useful in mail system testing).
    
    - `defer`: planned feature to defer mail delivery.
    
    - `auth`: planned feature to enable user authentication.
