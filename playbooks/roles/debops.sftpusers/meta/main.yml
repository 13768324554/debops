  synopsis: |
    `debops.sftpusers` role can be used to create and manage user accounts
    which have system access restricted to SFTP only.

  usage: |
    Access to SFTPonly accounts is allowed only using SSH public keys, but users
    cannot manage their own keys. Instead, sshd server uses keys from
    `/etc/ssh/authorized_keys/<user>` for authorization. Use `debops.sshkeys` role to
    manage these keys separately.
