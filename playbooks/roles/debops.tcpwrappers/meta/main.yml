  synopsis: |
    This role can be used to manage [TCP
    Wrappers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP\_Wrapper) rules located in
    `/etc/hosts.allow` (by default all hosts will be denied access in
    `/etc/hosts.deny`, but this can be disabled by a variable).
    
    Other roles can use this role as a dependency to manage access to their own
    services (for example, `debops.mysql`, `debops.sshd`).
