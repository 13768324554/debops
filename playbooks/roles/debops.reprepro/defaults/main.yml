# builds becomes available in DebOps cluster

# The FQDN of the host on which reprepro is configured; other hosts in the
# group/cluster will use this for obtaining apt keys and repository
# information. Set to False to disable reprepro. By default, it is defined by the
# 'apt' role in roles/apt/meta/main.yml

# 'reprepro' role requires a webserver to serve repository data, but currently
# it's not dependent on one, relying on 'apt' role to configure it beforehand.

# configure it's APT repository (webserver is configured)
