## debops.reprepro

[![Platforms](http://img.shields.io/badge/platforms-debian%20|%20ubuntu-lightgrey.svg)](#)

`debops.reprepro` role is used to create and manage local APT repository.
Packages can be uploaded manually to a specific user account, or they can
be downloaded by the role from specific directory on Ansible Controller.
Role will also automatically configure access to created APT repository on
all hosts managed by Ansible.

This role is by default not used directly by the playbook. Instead,
`debops.apt` role uses it as a dependency.
