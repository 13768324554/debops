# role: openvz (OpenVZ virtualization, containers)
# Homepage: http://openvz.org/


# openvz role is meant for a Hardware Node, not a Container. Containers can be
# managed by ginas proper, without adding them to 'ginas_openvz' group.
#
# openvz role uses Linux kernel from openvz.org (2.6.32), which is older than
# the default kernel in Wheezy (3.2.0). Because of that various technologies
# from Wheezy (KVM, LXC for example) might be incompatible with older kernel.
# I suggest that you should not mix OpenVZ with other virtualization roles
# on the same host.
#
# Ansible will not automatically reboot an OpenVZ Hardware Node. Instead it will
# send an email to root account on Hardware Node with a reminder.


# List of hosts in OpenVZ "cluster". These hosts will exchange SSH public keys
# from their root accounts between them and record their SSH fingerprints for
# easier container migration using vzmigrate.
# By default it's all hosts in 'ginas_openvz' group. You can change that by
# defining a list of hosts using their inventory_hostname variable
openvz_cluster: '{{ groups.ginas_openvz }}'

# Name of a kernel package (or metapackage) installed by openvz role
openvz_kernel: 'linux-image-openvz-amd64'

# Default GRUB menu entry to boot (counting from 0). When OpenVZ-enabled kernel
# is installed, it will be placed just after the official Debian kernel. Recovery
# option in GRUB should be disabled, which is the default when you use ginas
# Debian Preseed setup
openvz_grub_default: '1'

# Where to send mail reminders and alerts from openvz role
openvz_mail_to: [ 'root@{{ ansible_domain }}' ]

# Default filesystem layout for new OpenVZ containers (simfs, ploop)
openvz_storage_layout: 'ploop'

# Default configuration file for new OpenVZ containers
openvz_configfile: 'vswap-512m'

# Default container template - this template is from "contrib" repository, with
# a minimal set of Debian packages and sshd installed
# More information: https://projects.rackster.ch/OpenVZ/Templates/Debian%207/Overview.md
openvz_template: 'debian-7.0-amd64-minimal'

# Should OpenVZ automatically update template images?
openvz_template_update: 'yes'

# Should OpenVZ check gnupg signature of a template image? This is set to 'no'
# by default because selected default template above is not signed by openvz.org
# GPG key
openvz_template_signature: 'no'
