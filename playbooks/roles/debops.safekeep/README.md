## debops.safekeep

[![Platforms](http://img.shields.io/badge/platforms-debian%20|%20ubuntu-lightgrey.svg)](#)

### Warning, this is a BETA role

This role has been marked by the author as a beta role, which means that it
might be significantly changed in the future. Be careful while using this role
in a production environment.

***
This role will configure [SafeKeep](http://safekeep.sourceforge.net/)
scripts to create daily, incremental, centralized backups on a specified
server, based on `rdiff-backup`.

Currently SafeKeep packages are not available in Debian repositories; you
need to provide the packages to APT using some other way, for example via
local APT repository created using `debops.reprepro` role.

### Installation

To install `debops.safekeep` using Ansible Galaxy, run:

    ansible-galaxy install debops.safekeep

### Role dependencies
