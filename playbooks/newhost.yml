# playbooks/newhost.yml
#
# This playbook creates initial admin account and ensures that ansible can
# access the server through sudo. You should run it just after new server has
# been installed and connected to the network. Make sure that you can access
# it through ssh on the root account. You might have to provide a password (in
# that case use '-k' switch on the command line).
#
# Usage:
# ansible-playbook -k playbooks/newhost.yml --extra-vars="hosts=<hostname>"
#
# After securing access to the server by disabling the password authentication
# in sshd, this playbook is expected to not work properly.
