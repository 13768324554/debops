# This playbook can be used to bootstrap freshly installed minimal Debian
# system for Ansible management. The expected state the host:
#   - root account is configured with a known password;
#   - host has OpenSSH server installed and root can login with a password;
#   - default administrator account is not created;
#   - default administrator has no sudo access to root account;
#   - host is already configured in Ansible inventory/hosts file;
#   - local user has prepared SSH keypair in RSA format;
#
# Modifications that will be made on the host:
#   - playbook will install Python support with some essential software;
#   - a system 'admins' group will be created for users who have administrator
#     privileges (full sudo permissions);
#   - a normal user account named after your local user account will be
#     created and added to the 'admins' group;
#   - no passwords are set or modified on any account;
#
# Usage:
# ansible-playbook -i inventory playbooks/bootstrap.yml -k --limit host
#
# After securing access to the server by disabling the password authentication
# in sshd, this playbook is expected to not work correctly.
