`debops master`_ - unreleased
-----------------------------

.. _debops master: https://github.com/debops/debops/compare/v0.6.0...master

Added
~~~~~

- New Ansible roles have been imported from the ``debops-contrib``
  organization: ``apparmor``, ``bitcoind``, ``btrfs``, ``dropbear_initramfs``,
  ``etckeeper``, ``firejail``, ``foodsoft``, ``fuse``, ``homeassistant``,
  ``kernel_module``, ``kodi``, ``neurodebian``, ``snapshot_snapper``, ``tor``,
  ``volkszaehler``, ``x2go_server``. They are not yet included in the main
  playbook and still need to be renamed to fit with the rest of the
  ``debops.*`` roles.

- New DebOps roles:

  - ``debops.sysfs``: configuration of the Linux kernel attributes through the
    :file:`/sys` filesystem. The role is not enabled by default.

- You can now use Vagrant to create an Ansible Controller based on Debian
  Stretch and use it to manage itself or other hosts over the network.
  See the :file:`Vagrantfile` in the DebOps monorepo for more details.

- You can now build an Ansible Controller with DebOps support as a Docker
  container. See the :file:`Dockerfile` in the DebOps monorepo for details.

- You can now install DebOps on `Arch Linux <https://www.archlinux.org/>`__
  using an included ``PKGBUILD`` file.

- Add new playbook, ``agent.yml``. This playbook is executed at the end of the
  main playbook, and contains applications or services which act as "agents" of
  other services. They may contact their parent applications to report about
  the state of the host they are executed on, therefore the agents are
  installed and configured at the end of the main playbook.

- [debops.libvirtd] The role can now detect if nested KVM is enabled in
  a particular virtual machine and install KVM support.

Changed
~~~~~~~

- [debops-tools] The :command:`debops-update` script will now install or
  update the DebOps monorepo instead of separate ``debops-playbooks`` and
  DebOps roles git repositories. Existing installations shouldn't be affected.

- [debops-tools] The :command:`debops` script will now include the DebOps
  monorepo roles and playbooks in the generated :file:`ansible.cfg`
  configuration. The monorepo roles and playbooks are preferred over the old
  ``debops-playbooks`` ones.

  The script is backwards compatible and should work correctly with or without
  the ``debops-playbooks`` repository and roles installed.

- The project repository is tested using :command:`pycodestyle` for compliance
  with Python's `PEP8 Style Guide <https://pep8.org/>`_.

- [debops.nodejs] The ``npm`` package has been removed from Debian Stable.
  The role will now install NPM using the GitHub source, unless upstream NodeJS is
  enabled, which includes its own NPM version.

  The ``debops.nodejs`` role can now install `Yarn <https://yarnpkg.com/>`_
  package manager using its upstream APT repository (not enabled by default).

- [debops.gunicorn] Update the role to work correctly on Debian Stretch and
  newer releases. The support for multiple :command:`gunicorn` instances using
  custom Debian scripts has been removed in Debian Stretch, therefore the role
  replaces it with its own setup based on :command:`systemd` instances.

- [debops.gitlab_runner] The GitLab Runner playbook is moved to the
  ``agent.yml`` playbook; it will be executed at the end of the main playbook
  and should that way include correct information about installed services.

Removed
~~~~~~~

- [DebOps playbooks] Remove the :file:`ipaddr.py` Ansible filter plugin, it is
  now included in the Ansible core distribution.


debops v0.6.0 - 2017-10-21
--------------------------

Added
~~~~~

- Various repositories that comprise the DebOps project have been merged into
  a single monorepo which will be used as the main development repository.
  Check the :command:`git` log for information about older releases of DebOps
  roles and/or playbooks.
