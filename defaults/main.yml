# Additional options added in /etc/ssh/sshd_config, in text block format.

# Added at the begin of the configuration.
# Openssh reads its configuration form top to bottom and uses the first match for a keyword that it finds.
# So options set in sshd_config_options_begin will be used instead of options which follow after sshd_config_options_begin.
