# ---- ISC DHCP failover configuration ----
#
# Each failover declaration consists of primary and secondary host, no more
# than two nodes failover is allowed by isc-dhcpd currently.
#
# You must specify which failover each pool should use by specifying a
# 'failover peer' option in pool declaration.
#
# Each failover declaration has a set of an mandatory fields, which is:
#   primary: ""             Ansible inventory name of a primary DHCP host, if
#                           you need failover to work on different IP,
#                           see primary_fo_addr option below.
#
#   secondary: ""           Ansible inventory name of a secondary DHCP host, if
#                           you need failover to work on different IP,
#                           see secondary_fo_addr option below.
#
# Ansible inventory name is either IP ot hostname specified in inventory file.
#
#   mclt: 3600              Max Client Lead Time. The maximum amount of time
#                           that one server can extend a lease for a DHCP
#                           client beyond the time known by the partner server.
#
#   split: [0-255]          Specifies the split between the primary and
#                           secondary for the purposes of load balancing.
#                           Whenever a client makes a DHCP request, the DHCP
#                           server runs a hash on the client identification,
#                           resulting in value from 0 to 255. This is used as
#                           an index into a 256 bit field. If the bit at that
#                           index is set, the primary is responsible.  If
#                           the bit at that index is not set, the secondary
#                           is responsible.
#    -- or --
#   hba: ([0-9a-f]{2}:){32} Specifies the split between the primary and
#                           secondary as a bitmap rather than a cutoff, which
#                           theoretically allows for finer-grained control.
#                           In practice, there is probably no need for such
#                           fine-grained control, however.
#   max_response_delay: 5   Tells the DHCP server how many seconds may pass
#                           without receiving a message from its failover peer
#                           before it assumes that connection has failed.
#                           This is mandatory according to dhcpd.conf man page.
#   max_unacked_updates: 10 Tells the remote DHCP server how many BNDUPD
#                           messages it can send before it receives a BNDACK
#                           from the local system.
#                           This is mandatory according to dhcpd.conf man page.
#
# You must use either 'split' or 'hba' statement. Split has a preference, so
# if it's defined, 'hba' will be omitted by configuration template.
# Optional field are mostly desribed in dhcpd.conf man page:
#   port: 647               Specifies port on which primary and secondary
#                           nodes will listen for failover connection.
#                           Diffirent ports for primary and secondary is
#                           currently unsupported.
#
#   primary_fo_addr: ""     IP/Hostname of a primary DHCP host. This option
#                           is used if you need failover address be different
#                           from ansible inventory IP/hostname.
#                           If omitted, then 'primary' is used.
#
#   secondary_fo_addr: ""   IP/Hostname of a secondary DHCP host. This option
#                           is used if you need failover address be different
#                           from ansible inventory IP/hostname.
#                           If omitted, then 'secondary' is used.
#
#   auto_partner_down: 0    Number of second to start serving partners IPs
#                           after the partner's failure.
