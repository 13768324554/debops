# .. envvar:: fuse_restrict_access
#
# Should access to fuse and :file:`/dev/fuse` be restricted to root and the
# members of the fuse group?
# Debian used to have a group called fuse and users which should be allowed to use FUSE needed to be in that group.
# As of Debian Jessie, no group is being created by default and every user has access to fuse.
# https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=733312
# This was done to make it work by default with other packages which are based on FUSE.
fuse_restrict_access: False


# .. envvar:: fuse_users
#
# Which users should be allowed to use FUSE?
# Only takes affect when ``fuse_restrict_access`` is ``True``.
