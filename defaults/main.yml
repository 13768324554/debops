# role: ruby (Ruby language support)
# Homepage: https://www.ruby-lang.org/


# Ruby role supports different versions of Ruby (1.9.1, with is in Debian
# Wheezy and Ubuntu; and 2.1, which is in Debian Jessie). By default, Ruby 2.1 is
# installed (or backported on Wheezy). If you want to use Ruby 1.9.1, you should
# set that for all hosts in inventory before installing.

# Switching between versions isn't currently supported, and once Ruby 2.1
# packages are backported and put in local APT repository, it will be impossible
# to install Ruby 1.9.1 due to backported 'ruby' package having higher
# perecedence than version from distribution repositories.

# Specify version of Ruby to install:
# - '1.9.1' will install Ruby from Debian/Ubuntu stable repositories
# - '2.1' on Debian Wheezy will backport packages from Debian Jessie, on Jessie
#   they will be installed as normal (Ubuntu at the moment is not supported)
ruby_version: '2.1'


# Lists of additional APT packages to install with Ruby packages (for all
# hosts, group of hosts, specific host or role dependency). You can use these
