## DebOps Changelog

Welcome... to the Real World.

### Changelog for 1st September 2014

We are starting the main project repository anew! The old `ginas/ginas`
repository will be preserved for historic reasons as `debops/ginas` after main
project gets up to speed. For now, if you want to play with DebOps, I suggest
heading to [ginas](https://github.com/ginas/ginas/) repository and cloning that
instead. That should be fixed soon though, when new role cloning code takes
shape.
