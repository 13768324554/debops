MariaDB_ is a popular relational SQL database that was forked from MySQL
server. Ansible roles debops.mariadb_ and debops.mariadb_server_ allow
you to manage a MariaDB server and / or access it remotely from other hosts.

debops.mariadb_ role is the "client" part - it installs ``mariadb-client``
Debian package, and uses Ansible delegation to configure users and databases in
local or remote MariaDB servers. You can use debops.mariadb_server_ role to
manage the MariaDB server itself.
