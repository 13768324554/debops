Code signing policy
===================

The code used by the DebOps Project and commited in its repositories is
expected to be signed by a valid GPG key of a DebOps Developer or DebOps
Contributor. This should allow for secure code authentication and a valid audit
trail.

This rule should take effect on **1st September 2016**.
