Checkout the following example to get started:

.. code-block:: console

   curl --silent https://api.debops.org/roles/debops.unattended_upgrades.json | jq '.'

You can also open that URL in your browser via HTTP GET:
https://api.debops.org/roles/debops.unattended_upgrades.json

But note that the encoded JSON object is not prettified.
