==========

The creation of DebOps wouldn't be possible without massive amounts of
documentation, knowledge and know-how present on the Internet. Many solutions
to problems encountered during the development have been found on various
blogs, HOWTOs and other documentation, it would be hard to list them all.
However, there are some notable entries which you can use for reference during
the development of your own IT infrastructure.
