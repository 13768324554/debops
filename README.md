## debops.monit
[![Platforms](http://img.shields.io/badge/platforms-debian%20|%20ubuntu-lightgrey.svg)](#)


`debops.monit` role allows you to install and configure
[Monit](http://mmonit.com/monit/) service which can be used to monitor
processes, services or even other hosts. You can also use this role as
a dependency of another role and configure monitoring service for an
application this way.

Alerts can be sent to an e-mail address (by default
`monitoring@<your-domain>`, or to a mobile phone or pager using an SMS
gateway (for example one managed by `debops.smstools` role).
