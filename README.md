This role is meant to be a simple SSL certificate manager which:

* creates self-signed certificate for a host, along with a CSR;

* uploads the CSR for its certificate to Ansible Controller for easy
  signing by a CA;

* downloads signed certificate from Ansible Controller when it becomes
  available;

* downloads custom CA or wildcard certificates provided to the role by
  administrator in a specifc directory on Ansible Controller;

`debops.pki` role is planned to be rewritten to support automatic CA
signing and custom certificates for clients/applications.
