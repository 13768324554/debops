The `debops-contrib.btrfs` Ansible role allows you manage your Btrfs.
Currently the role supports management of Btrfs subvolumes.
More can be implemented as needed.

This role requires the Ansible module `btrfs_subvolume` which is not yet
included in Ansible.
You can find it here: https://github.com/surpr1ze/ansible-btrfs-subvolume

You may need to include missing roles from the [DebOps common
playbook](https://github.com/debops/debops-playbooks/blob/master/playbooks/common.yml)
into your playbook.
