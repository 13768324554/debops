Ansible role to install and manage AppArmor.
AppArmor is able to restrict what programs can do and access based on policies for those programs.

See [AppArmor in the Debian Wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/AppArmor/HowToUse).

By default (e.g. no [auditd] installed) log messages are logged via syslog to
the kernel facility which usually ends up under `/var/log/kern.log`.

[auditd]: https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=auditd

### Installation

This role requires at least Ansible `v2.0.0`. To install it, run:

```Shell
ansible-galaxy install debops-contrib.apparmor
```
