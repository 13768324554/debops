This role can be used to manage network interface configuration on Debian
and derivative operating systems. It manages configuration in
the `/etc/network/` directory and can be used to create different
interface layouts across the cluster.

The `debops.ifupdown` role tries to recognize several environments (LXC
container, OpenVZ container, system with installed NetworkManager) and can
automatically select one of the suggested configurations. For most
scenarios, `debops.ifupdown` will try to configure up to two network
interfaces (non-existent interfaces are gracefully skipped) with network
bridges attached to them, which allows to easily connect virtual machines
or containers to the public or private network.

In case an advanced configuration is required (more than two network
interfaces, bonding, modem connections, NAT, etc.), you can easily override
the automatically selected configuration using Ansible inventory. This role can
also be used as a dependency of another role which allows for example to
easily manage NAT networks using the `debops.subnetwork` role.

Some features of interface declarations require additional packages.
One of those packages is `resolvconf` (as defined in `ifupdown_packages`)
which will start to manage your `/etc/resolv.conf` file.

### Installation

This role requires at least Ansible `v1.8.0`. To install it, run:
