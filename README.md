[Elasticsearch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticsearch) is a distributed
search engine and storage system, also a part of the Elasticsearch, Logstash,
Kibana (ELK) stack. The software is developed by [Elastic](https://eastic.co/).

The `debops.elasticsearch` Ansible role can be used to deploy and manage
Elasticsearch instances on one or more (3+) hosts. The role can be used as
a dependency by other Ansible roles to allow control over their configuration
options in the Elasticsearch configuration file.
