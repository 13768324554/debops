`debops.libvirt` role can be used to manage networks and storage pools defined
in [libvirt](http://libvirt.org/) virtualization service. It's designed to be
used either "locally", directly on a given host, or "remotely" from a central
host through the API.

To configure a host to provide `libvirtd` service you can use `debops.libvirtd`
role.
