[SKS Keyserver](https://sks-keyservers.net/) is an OpenPGP/GnuPG key
server. This role allows you to install and manage one or more keyservers
in a cluster. Specified host (by default first host in `[debops_sks]`
Ansible group) will also be configured as a web frontend to the cluster
(`nginx` will be used as the frontend webserver).

You can use `debops.sks` role to create your own keyserver pool (and in
extension your own OpenPGP Web of Trust) or [connect to an existing
pool](http://www.keysigning.org/sks/). In the latter case, role supports an
option to not initialize the database by default, in which case you can
seed your local key database from a keyserver dump (which is a preferred
option of connecting to the existing pool because of the size of existing
key database dumps).


### Installation

This role requires at least Ansible `v1.7.0`. To install it, run:

    ansible-galaxy install debops.sks



### Role dependencies

- `debops.apt_preferences`
- `debops.etc_services`
- `debops.ferm`
- `debops.nginx`



### Role variables

List of default variables available in the inventory:

    ---
    
    # Automatically create keyserver database? Database will be empty
    # If you want to seed the database with public GPG keys or connect to public
    # SKS Keyserver network, you should set this variable to "False" and seed the
    # database manually. See: http://keysigning.org/sks/
    sks_autoinit: False
    
    # GPG fingerprint of server administrator
    sks_contact: ''
    
    # From header for outgoing mail
    sks_from: 'PGP Key Server <pgp-public-keys@{{ ansible_fqdn }}>'
    
    # DNS domain on which SKS frontend webserver should be configured
    sks_domain: [ 'keyserver.{{ ansible_domain }}' ]
    
    # Ansible group of hosts which are included in SKS cluster
    sks_cluster: '{{ groups.debops_sks }}'
    
    # List of inventory hosts which provide frontend web service
    sks_frontends: [ '{{ sks_cluster[0] }}' ]
    
    # List of hosts which can connect to hkp service. If this list is empty,
    # anybody can connect.
    sks_hkp_allow: []
    
    # List of public SKS keyservers you want to peer with. It's a list of simple
    # lines, which allows you to include custom ports and comments (see sks(8)
    # documentation). It's good etiquette to ask someone for permission before you
    # add their server to this list (and their server needs to have yours for the
    # communication to work).
    # You should probably connect only one of your private keyservers to the public
    # keyserver network, your other servers will propagate the changes between
    # themselves.
    sks_public_list: []
    #  - name: 'keyserver.example.org'
    #    port: '{{ sks_recon_port }}'
    #    email: 'Server Administrator <root@example.org'
    #    gpg: '0xDEADBEEF'
