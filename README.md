[Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange][] is a way to securely share encryption keys
publicly between two parties. It's used in TLS and SSL connections to
provide [Perfect Forward Secrecy][]. Unfortunately, default DH parameters
distributed with applications are suspectible to a [downgrade attack][].

The `debops.dhparam` Ansible role will generate a set of strong
Diffie-Hellman parameters on Ansible Controller, which will be preseeded on
remote hosts, and will be ready to use by other applications. A separate
script can then be used on remote hosts in the background to generate new
random DH parameters, either once or in regular intervals.
