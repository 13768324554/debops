`etc_services` role can be used to "reserve" or "register" a service port
in `/etc/services` file. Service ports configured this way can appear as
named entries in many command outputs, such as `iptables -L` or `netstat -lp`.
You can also have convenient database of reserved and free ports on
a particular host, and reference ports by their names in firewall
configuration files.
