`debops.reprepro` role is used to create and manage local APT repository.
Packages can be uploaded manually to a specific user account, or they can
be downloaded by the role from specific directory on Ansible Controller.
Role will also automatically configure access to created APT repository on
all hosts managed by Ansible.

This role is by default not used directly by the playbook. Instead,
`debops.apt` role uses it as a dependency.





### Installation

This role requires at least Ansible `v1.7.0`. To install it, run:

    ansible-galaxy install debops.reprepro

#### Are you using this as a standalone role without DebOps?

You may need to include missing roles from the [DebOps common
playbook](https://github.com/debops/debops-playbooks/blob/master/playbooks/common.yml)
into your playbook.

    # 'apt' role in roles/apt/meta/main.yml
    reprepro: False
    
    # 'reprepro' role requires a webserver to serve repository data, but currently
    # it's not dependent on one, relying on 'apt' role to configure it beforehand.
    # This variable set by the 'apt' role specifies that 'reprepro' role can
    # configure it's APT repository (webserver is configured)
