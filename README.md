`debops.ruby` role installs selected Ruby version via APT package manager.
By default, version `2.1` will be installed, but you can also specify
version `1.9.1` to install packages already present in your distribution
(Ubuntu or Debian Wheezy).

If you are installing Ruby 2.1 packages on Debian Wheezy, this role will
use `debops.backporter` role to automatically backport all required
packages from Debian Jessie. These packages will be installed on the build
host and uploaded to Ansible Controller to a specific directory, where
`debops.reprepro` role can find them and automatically import them to local
APT repository, at which point these packages will become available to all
hosts in a cluster.

This role will also install gems from [RubyGems](http://rubygems.org/)
specified in a list.
