`debops.mailman v0.1.1`_ - 2016-03-30
-------------------------------------

.. _debops.mailman v0.1.1: https://github.com/debops/ansible-mailman/compare/v0.1.0...v0.1.1

Changed
~~~~~~~

- Configure the site domain in Postfix using Ansible local facts.

  The site domain should be configured as ``mydestination`` when local mail is
  enabled in Postfix. It should not be set as a virtual domain in Mailman to
  not generate unnecessary virtual aliases, which break mail delivery.
  [drybjed]

debops.mailman v0.1.0 - 2016-03-07
----------------------------------

Added
~~~~~

- Add Changelog. [drybjed]

- Add configuration for ``debops.apt_preferences`` and
  ``debops.unattended_upgrades`` Ansible roles. [drybjed]

- Add a default variable with custom ``debops.nginx`` server options for
  Mailman server. [drybjed]

Changed
~~~~~~~

- Switch from patching the Mailman source code manually to using the ``patch``
  Ansible module. Patches are no longer copied to remote host and their state
  is not stored on the server, however it's easy to apply them again if
  necessary using a dedicated tag. [drybjed]

- Perform UTF-8 conversion of Polish language pack only on Debian Wheezy and
  Ubuntu Precise, newer OS releases should be fine. [drybjed]

- Restart Mailman on configuration changes. [drybjed]

- Clean up APT package installation, expose list of packages in default
  variables. [drybjed]

- Rewrite the language pack support.

  The role now exposes simple list of languages which is converted by a lookup
  template to set the ``debconf`` questions correctly. List of active languages
  is taken into account, so both data sources (Ansible default variables and
  ``debconf`` database) shouldn't fight over which languages are active
  anymore.

  The language pack conversion script has been rewritten to be idempotent and
  it's not installed on the remote host, but executed by the ``script`` module
  if any changes are detected. [drybjed]

- Redesign the configuration of Mailman domains. The default domain is now set
  in a separate ``mailman__site_domain`` variable, and additional virtual
  domains have their own list. [drybjed]

- Clean up role tasks and handlers, conver them to YAML syntax. [drybjed]

- Clean up Mailman configuration file. [drybjed]

- Rename all variables to put them in a clear namespace. [drybjed]

- Update documentation. [drybjed]

- Reorder the fastcgi parameters in ``nginx`` configuration to fix issue with
  `fcgiwrap interpreting the first occurence <http://mailman.nginx.org/pipermail/nginx/2012-June/034224.html>`_
  of the variable instead of the last. [drybjed]

Removed
~~~~~~~

- Remove hard role dependencies on ``debops.postfix`` and ``debops.nginx``.
  Configuration for ``debops.postfix`` and ``debops.nginx`` roles is defined in
  default variables, which can be passed to the roles through the playbook.

  Remove direct configuration of ``fcgiwrap`` instance and use
  ``debops.fcgiwrap`` role to configure a ``mailman`` instance. [drybjed]

- Drop Ansible local facts related to Mailman. [drybjed]
