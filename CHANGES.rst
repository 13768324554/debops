debops.dnsmasq v0.1.0 - unreleased
----------------------------------

Added
~~~~~

- Add Changelog. [drybjed]

- Add variables to enable / disable ``bogus-priv`` and ``stop-dns-rebind``
  options. These need to be disabled if you want to experiment with multiple
  nested private networks without DNS issues. [drybjed]

- Allow to use custom upstream nameservers. [ypid]

Changed
~~~~~~~

- Change default TFTP root directory to ``/srv/tftp/`` to be compatible with
  defaults from ``tftpd-hpa`` package. [drybjed]

- Switch from PXE boot to iPXE boot and drop support for installation of Debian
  Netboot Installer. Custom menu will be handled by a separate role. [drybjed]

- Use real hostname as the ``A`` record on the gateway interface and point
  ``gw`` ``CNAME`` to it. [drybjed]

- Create TFTP root directory if not present. [drybjed]

- Use ``bind-dynamic`` option in newer OSes instead of ``bind-interfaces``,
  this should fix an issue when changes in the network interface topology
  required ``dnsmasq`` to be restarted to listen on new interfaces. [drybjed]

Removed
~~~~~~~

- Remove "short subdomain" ``CNAME`` entries generated by Ansible from
  ``dnsmasq`` configuration. These entries may confuse DNS, it's better if
  ``search`` parameter in ``/etc/resolv.conf`` includes all relevant domains
  and subdomains instead. [drybjed]

- Remove "short subdomain" ``CNAME`` entries from main ``dnsmasq``
  configuration file. [drybjed]
