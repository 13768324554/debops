  synopsis: |
    ``debops.openvz`` role enables `OpenVZ`_ container support on Debian Wheezy
    hosts. This role has not been tested on Debian Jessie or Ubuntu systems,
    and correct support for OpenVZ on these systems is at the moment unlikely.
    Main reason for this role is to help ease transition from older systems
    based on Debian Squeeze with OpenVZ into newer systems based on Debian
    Wheezy/Jessie and LXC.

  usage: |
    This role is meant to create and manage OpenVZ Hardware Nodes, not OpenVZ
    containers themselves.
    
    ``debops.openvz`` role uses `Linux kernel from openvz.org`_ (2.6.32), which
    is older than the default kernel in Wheezy (3.2.0). Because of that various
    technologies from Wheezy (KVM, LXC for example) might be incompatible with
    older kernel. Thus, this role should not be mixed on one host with those
    technologies.
    
    Because of the kernel downgrade, a reboot of the host will be required, but
    ``debops.openvz`` will not reboot managed hosts automatically. Instead, an
    email will be sent to ``root`` account in case a kernel downgrade or update
    is performed, to notify the administrator about required reboot. This lets
    the administrator schedule reboots at their convenience. Make sure that
    your Hardware Nodes have correct mail setup to forward mails to
    administrators, for example with ``debops.postfix`` role.
    
    You can specify a group of hosts (by default role looks for
    ``[debops_openvz]`` group), in which case they will be treated as a cluster
    of OpenVZ Hardware Nodes. Each HN will create an SSH keypair on its ``root``
    account, and these keys will be automatically distributed among nodes in
    the cluster, and the host SSH fingerprints will be registered on each node
    ``~/.ssh/known_hosts`` file. This allows you to easily migrate containers
    between Hardware Nodes with ``vzmigrate`` command.
