  synopsis: |
    ``debops.etc_services`` role can be used to "reserve" or "register"
    a service port in ``/etc/services`` file. Service ports configured this way
    can appear as named entries in many command outputs, such as
    ``iptables -L`` or ``netstat -lp``.  You can also have convenient database
    of reserved and free ports on a particular host, and reference ports by
    their names in firewall configuration files.
