  synopsis: |
    `debops.gitusers` role can be used to create and maintain user accounts
    accessible over SSH with limited functionality provided by `git-shell` and
    a set of shell scripts. These accounts can provide users with limited shell
    functionality and ability to create git repositories on the server, which
    then can be used to "deploy" web content (HTML, CSS, PHP5 web pages,
    support for other environments might be included in the future).
    
    You can think of this role as a simple [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) or
    [PagodaBox](https://pagodabox.com/) clone.
