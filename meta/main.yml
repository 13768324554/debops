  synopsis: |
    This role is meant to be a simple SSL certificate manager which:
    
      * creates self-signed certificate for a host, along with a CSR;
      * uploads the CSR for its certificate to Ansible Controller for easy
        signing by a CA;
      * downloads signed certificate from Ansible Controller when it becomes
        available;
      * downloads custom CA or wildcard certificates provided to the role by
        administrator in a specifc directory on Ansible Controller;
    
    `debops.pki` role is planned to be rewritten to support automatic CA
    signing and custom certificates for clients/applications.
