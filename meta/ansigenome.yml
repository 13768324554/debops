  synopsis: |
    `debops.contrib-etckeeper` will install [etckeeper][] which puts `/etc`
    under version control. To do this it hooks into the package management and
    from now on automatically commit changes to a local git repository under
    `/etc/.git`.

    This makes it easy to see which changes are applied on a specific host and
    quickly revert them, if something breaks.

    ### Credits
    This role was influenced by [groover.etckeeper](https://github.com/silpion/ansible-etckeeper)
    but has been rewritten from scratch to make it suitable for the DebOps project.
