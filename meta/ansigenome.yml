  synopsis: |
    [etckeeper] makes it easy to put `/etc`
    under version control by hooking into the package management systems and
    automatically committing changes. This makes it easy to see which changes
    are applied on a specific host and quickly revert them, if something
    breaks.

    ### Credits
    This role was influenced by [groover.etckeeper](https://github.com/silpion/ansible-etckeeper)
    but has been rewritten from scratch to make it suitable for the DebOps project.
