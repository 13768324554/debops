    The default of Foodsoft is to redirect to HTTPS so be sure to setup a certificate for example via [debops.pki].
    Also note that this role uses the [DebOps](http://debops.org/) project to setup the
    webserver and configure the database. Be sure to check it out! :smile: Thanks to [Maciej Delmanowski](https://github.com/drybjed) for the amazing work.
