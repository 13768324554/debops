  synopsis: |
    This role allows you to configure a encrypted filesystem on top of any given
    block device using [dm-crypt][]/[cryptsetup][] and [LUKS][].  A random keyfile generated on the Ansible
    controller will be used for the encryption by default.  It is your
    responsibility that the keyfile is kept secure for this to make sense.  For
    example by storing the keyfile on a already encrypted filesystem (both on
    the Ansible controller and the remote system).

    [dm-crypt]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dm-crypt
    [cryptsetup]: https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup

    ### Features

    * Create a random keyfile or use an already existing file.
    * Manage `/etc/crypttab` and `/etc/fstab`.
    * Create a LUKS header backup and store it on the Ansible controller.

    ### Note

    This role is currently being migrated to the DebOps project.
    For the time in between, this role is available under itâ€™s old name on
    Ansible Galaxy as
    [`ypid.crypttab`](https://galaxy.ansible.com/detail#/role/4559).
