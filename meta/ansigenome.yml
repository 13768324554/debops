  synopsis: |
    AppArmor is able to restrict what programs can do and access based on policies for those programs.

    See [AppArmor in the Debian Wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/AppArmor/HowToUse).

    By default (e.g. no [auditd] installed) log messages from AppArmor are
    logged via syslog to the kernel facility which usually ends up under
    `/var/log/kern.log`.
