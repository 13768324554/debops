  synopsis: |
    This role setups up and configures AppArmor.
    AppArmor is able to restrict what programs can do and access based on policies for those programs.

    See [AppArmor in the Debian Wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/AppArmor/HowToUse).

    By default (e.g. no [auditd] installed) log messages are logged via syslog to
    the kernel facility which usually ends up under `/var/log/kern.log`.
