script:

  # First, check the playbook for any syntax errors
  - ansible-playbook -i contrib/travis-ci/inventory playbooks/site.yml --syntax-check

  # Run main playbook
  - ansible-playbook -i contrib/travis-ci/inventory playbooks/site.yml

  # Run main playbook again to test idempotency (courtesy of geerlingguy, thanks!)
  # This test is not essential and will not generate Travis errors, but might
  # indicate problems with idempotency.
  # Reason for that is that some git repositories that are cloned during
  # playbook run might change in the meantime, which will count as
  # non-idempotency, but it shouldn't affect testing.
