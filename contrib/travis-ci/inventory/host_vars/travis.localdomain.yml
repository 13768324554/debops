# host: travis.localdomain


# This is an example all-in-one host for Travis CI testing. Travis CI uses
# Ubuntu 12.04 LTS distribution and OpenVZ host as testing environment. This is
# not a main target for ginas, but no matter - let's enable as much as possible
# and see what happens.

# Different services (Samba, NFS, etc.) are enabled as Ansible groups, see in
# 'inventory/hosts' what will be enabled by default.


# ---- Things that are usually enabled in production ----
# Secret storage on Ansible Controller, allows for random passwords and
# transfer of confidental data between Ansible Controler and servers
secret: '/tmp'

# Define some admin accounts (su and sudo access)
auth_admin_accounts: [ 'travis' ]

# APT services (Debian preseeding, apt-cacher-ng, reprepro) on a separate host,
# here points to itself
apt: '{{ ansible_fqdn }}'

# BoxBackup server, also points to itself
boxbackup: '{{ ansible_fqdn }}'

# Disable ferm (iptables) support due to missing requirements in OpenVZ
ferm: False

# Enable NFS server on this host
nfs_server: True

# Configure everything that we have in the mail server
# See playbooks/roles/postfix/defaults/main.yml for more information

# Enable PHPMyAdmin for MySQL database access

# By default on Travis CI distribution codename is 'precise', but ginas does
# not support that yet. So let's force Debian by default
apt_codename: 'wheezy'

# ownCloud from default upstream would not install correctly from official
# upstream (on a testing host), let's point it to a custom repository for now
