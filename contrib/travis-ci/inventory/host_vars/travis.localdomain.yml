# host: travis.localdomain


# This is an example all-in-one host for Travis CI testing. Travis CI uses
# Ubuntu 12.04 LTS distribution and OpenVZ host as testing environment. This is
# not a main target for ginas, but no matter - let's enable as much as possible
# and see what happens.

# Different services (Samba, NFS, etc.) are enabled as Ansible groups, see in
# 'inventory/hosts' what will be enabled by default.


# ---- Things that are usually enabled in production ----
# Secret storage on Ansible Controller, allows for random passwords and
# transfer of confidental data between Ansible Controler and servers
secret: '/tmp'

# Define some admin accounts (su and sudo access)
auth_admin_accounts: [ 'travis' ]

# APT services (Debian preseeding, apt-cacher-ng, reprepro) on a separate host,
# here points to itself
apt: '{{ ansible_fqdn }}'

# Looks like default hostname on Travis is too long for default nginx configuration,
# let's define shorter hostname for Debian Preseed
apt_debian_preseed_hostname: '{{ inventory_hostname }}'

# BoxBackup server, also points to itself
boxbackup: '{{ ansible_fqdn }}'

# Disable ferm (iptables) support due to missing requirements in OpenVZ
ferm: False

# Enable NFS server on this host
nfs_server: True

# Configure everything that we have in the mail server
# See playbooks/roles/postfix/defaults/main.yml for more information
postfix: [ 'local', 'network', 'mx', 'submission', 'deprecated',
           'postscreen', 'dnsbl', 'dnswl', 'test', 'mailman' ]

# Mailman requires FQDN address for site administrator, hostname is not enough
mailman_site_admin: 'listmaster@{{ ansible_fqdn }}'

# Enable PHPMyAdmin for MySQL database access
mysql_phpmyadmin: True

# Create some example databases
mysql_databases:
  - name: 'travis'

# Create sample users to access these databases
mysql_users:
  - name: 'travis'
    host: 'localhost'
    priv: '*.*:ALL,GRANT'

  - name: 'travis'
    host: '127.0.0.%'
    priv: '*.*:ALL,GRANT'

# Install database support in PHP5
php5_packages: [ 'php5-mysql', 'php5-pgsql' ]

# Disable samba iptables management on OpenVZ (we lack access to the kernel)
samba_iptables: False

# Seems that default PostgreSQL configuration on Travis has too big memory
# requirements, let's try to remedy that and don't change shared memory
# settings
postgresql_sysctl_shm_multiplier: False


# ---- Things specific to Ubuntu ----
# By default on Travis CI distribution codename is 'precise', but ginas does
# not support that yet. So let's force Debian by default
apt_codename: 'wheezy'

# /etc/init.d/samba init script in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS is named 'smbd'
samba_service_name: 'smbd'

# I'm not sure why, but ownCloud cannot be automatically configured on Travis
# CI instance anymore, and yet it still works correctly on Debian hosts. Until
# that changes, auto configuration will be disabled on Travis
owncloud_autosetup: False
